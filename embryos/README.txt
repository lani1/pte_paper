This folder includes the R code to run analyses and create visualizations for the embryo cohort presented in the corresponding paper (in prep). 

The following scripts are enclosed here:
em_embryo_hc.R this script analyses the electron microscopy data from embryos.
embryo_body_volumes.R this script analyzes the volume of the embryo bodies estimated from whole-body masks to estimate intrauterine growth restriction.
niagara_run_cropped_brain_model.R This script is designed to be run on the compute canada cluster (niagara). This script analyzes data produced from the cropped head deformation based morphometry (DBM). 
niagara_run_organ_model.R. This script is designed to be run on the compute canada cluster (niagara). This script analyses data produced from the whole-body DBM with a mask to look specifically at organs.
